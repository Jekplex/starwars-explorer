# Star Wars Explorer â€“ Proof of Concept

A lightweight proof of concept web app that allows **Star Wars fans** to keep track of what theyâ€™ve seen in the Star Wars universe â€” specifically **movies and TV shows**. This project is exploratory in nature and aims to lay the foundation for a fan-focused tracking experience.
